## App Overview

### Introduction
The agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the economies of Indonesia and South Sulawesi, contributing significantly to GDP and employment. However, challenges such as low farmer education levels and limited access to agricultural information persist.

### Solution
To address these challenges, a dedicated farmer discussion forum integrated with a chatbot was developed. This platform enables farmers to share insights, seek advice, and access information conveniently.

### Key Features
- **Farmer Discussion Forum**: Facilitates discussions and knowledge sharing among farmers.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Provides real-time assistance and answers queries from farmers.
- **NLP-enabled Connectivity**: Uses natural language processing for interaction with the forum database.
- **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing ensures functionality and reliability.

### Development Process
1. **Firebase Integration**: Utilized Firebase services for authentication, real-time database, Firestore, and storage to efficiently manage user data and media assets.
2. **Architecture and Technology Stack**:
   - Implemented clean architecture for modular development and maintainability.
   - Utilized dependency injection with Hilt Dagger for managing dependencies and promoting code scalability.
   - Leveraged reactive programming to ensure responsive user interfaces and streamline data flow.
3. **Wireframe Design**: The app's UI/UX design was meticulously planned using wireframes. A screenshot of the wireframe will be provided, and the Figma link can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ALPxL8hib3Sj4j7uqsH3ox/eFarm?type=design&node-id=86%3A121&mode=design&t=Gia4F02VOIHBCITf-1).
